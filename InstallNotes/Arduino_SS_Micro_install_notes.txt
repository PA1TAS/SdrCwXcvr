Compiling and down loading the the si5351_SSMicro_SDR_QUISK sketch requires no specail handling other than noting that the included github library "Etherkit_Si5351"
has been modified to work with this sketch. So must be in your arduino/libraries folder for this sketch to work as intended.

After the your satisfied that the sketch and board are functional, you may wish to improve the accuracy of the RF frequency settings/display. To do so find the line in the sketch that reads as follows:
        int XtalErr = -9500; // integer value measured to 0.01 Hertz ie 100 = 1.00Hz
use WWV @ 10MHz to establish the error correction needed, and modify the above line accordingly

QSK T/R relay operation may be adjusted by modifying the parameters used in the, "getNxtKeyStroke(bool Active)" routine. As its configured now, the relay will try to follow symbol (dot/dash) operations, for code sent under 20WPM, and will operate at "letter rate" for code speeds > 20WPM.
