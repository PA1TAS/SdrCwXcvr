Hint: Before doing anything, read all the way through these notes first

on Linux Mint 20
Before FLDIGI can be compiled from source code, Mint 20 needs the following “prep- steps”: 

1. Choose System->Software Sources from the main menu to open the Software Sources program

    click the Source code repositories button
    click the OK button


2. See Instructions found at:
http://www.w1hkj.com/doku/doku.php?id=howto:building_on_debian-ubuntu-mint
From the above site, the Two main instructions to follow are:
  Install the basic development packages (all distros)
    $ sudo aptitude install build-essential
  Install the build dependency packages (all distros)
    $ sudo aptitude build-dep fldigi

3. Use synaptic package Manager to install: libsamplerate0-dev
4. Use synaptic package Manager to install: portaudio19-dev
5. Use synaptic package Manager to install: libpulse-dev



The "sudo aptitude build-dep fldigi" command installed the following:
  asciidoc asciidoc-base{a} asciidoc-common{a} autoconf{a} automake{a} autopoint{a} autotools-dev{a} debhelper
    dh-autoreconf{a} dh-strip-nondeterminism{a} docbook-xsl dwz{a} libfile-stripnondeterminism-perl{a}
    libflac-dev{a} libflxmlrpc-dev libflxmlrpc1v5{a} libhamlib-dev libhamlib2{a} libogg-dev{a} libsndfile1-dev
    libtool{a} libusb-1.0-0-dev{a} libvorbis-dev{a} libxml2-utils{a} po-debconf{a} xsltproc
  The following packages are RECOMMENDED but will NOT be installed:
    asciidoc-dblatex asciidoc-doc libarchive-cpio-perl libltdl-dev libmail-sendmail-perl libusb-1.0-doc
    vim-asciidoc xmlto xmlto:i386

After completing/verifying the above packages have been installed, you can now begin the source code compile/install steps:
 
1. Go here to download my version of FLDIGI:

https://github.com/jmharvey1/SdrCwXcvr/blob/master/FLDIGI/fldigi-KW4KD.tar.gz

2. Create a workspace folder in your home directory i.e MintFLDIGI

3. Unpack the tarball (fldigi-KW4KD.tar.gz) to your workspace directory.
4. Now find the fldigi-4.0.1 folder inside your workspace directory, and open it.
5. Next,  "Right Click" the opened folder (fldigi-4.0.1 ) and choose "Open in terminal".
 in the command terminal window do these steps:

1. confirm the terminal window is in the correct folder. It should read similar to this:

                jim@SamsungMint20:~/FLDIGI/fldigi-4.0.1$

2. run: ./configure
3. run: make
4. run: sudo make install

Summary/output of the above steps:
FLDIGI “./config” command should conclude with this listing:
